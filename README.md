# KIRA-PLASTININA
This repository contains two notebooks. One contains my analysis and ML model that is meant to predict who is most likely to click on an ad related to a cryptography course. The other notebook contains analysis and an unsupervised learning model built for a personal project. Both projects are not done for real clients

## Description
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups. They have asked me to use my expertise as a Data Scientist to build a model to help the learn these caharacteristics.
